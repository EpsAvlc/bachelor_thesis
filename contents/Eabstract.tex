The activity in the area of unmaned ground vehicles navigation in recent years has initiated a eries of reactions that stirred the automobile industry. In the area of unmaned ground vehicles, 3d obstacle detection has always been a hot topic. A good obstacle result may benefit UGV's route plan and obstacle avoidance.For detecting 3d obstacles, LiDAR is widely used.However, 3d points Lidar's point cloud are unorderde and sparse, which challenging the task of 3d obstacle detetction.

A novel mechanism is proposed in this paper to handle the sparse point cloud by reciprocating the Lidar sensor in the heading direction.In addition, this paper proposes a method which recitifys the motion distortion of LiDAR by multiple lineary interpolation in a single point cloud, thus imporves the performance of multiple frame fusion.

Futhermore, camera image and lidar data are fused after calibing the lidar and cameras's extrins paramters.This paper also uses point cloud to optimize the performance of objection detection accuracy based on image.
